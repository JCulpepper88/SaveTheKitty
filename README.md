Save the Kitty
==============

Get the weapon and kill the monster before it gets to the kitty!

Each level is an array of characters parsed by the program.

In Level 1, the monster moves in a random direction whenever the user moves. In subsequent levels, the monster moves in a random direction every half second.

## Issues

* Only 2 levels so far
* The holes and walls in Level 2 are not yet responsive.
